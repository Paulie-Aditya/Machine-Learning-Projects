This is a Mini Project made by me for generating Shakespeare-like Sonnets/Poems.

We use a next character predictor type approach to generate the sonnets.
The model has been made to learn from the data in 'Sonnets.txt' and uses a Sliding Window type approach to understand the data and the next character that comes with it.

Accordingly, we adjust the temperature/experimentality to check which one gives the best output.


Based on the given data and our model, the best temperature is somewhere in the range of 0.4 and 0.6 since higher the temp, more experimental the values.
